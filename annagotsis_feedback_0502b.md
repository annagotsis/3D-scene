| *Punctuality (4f)* |  | Start Date: 5/1/2017 End Date: 5/3/2017 |
| *Version Control (4e)* |  | 23 commits |
| *Code Style (4c)* |  | Error count: N/A, Error type: N/A |
| *Best Practices (4b)* |  |  |
| *Physics or Tweening (3a, 3b)* | 45 | Physics is not fully generalized (hardcoded acceleration, increment on y axis only; -10)—not that much more effort to make it a completely generalized position-velocity-acceleration system …but then again, two scenes implemented, so that counts for something (+5) |
| *Interaction (1c, 3b, 3d, 4a)* | 50 | Choice of scenes and ability to clear them work out nicely |
| **TOTAL** | 95 |
